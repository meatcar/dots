Supports Linux and WSL.

## Installation

1. Install GNU Stow via your favourite package manager.
2. Run `stow stow`
3. Run `stow`, followed by any directory in this repo.

I'm slowly moving my configuration over to Nix. Here's how to use that:

1. Install [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/download.html)
1. Install [Nixpkgs](https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/download.html)
1. Install [Home Manager](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager)
1. Run `stow nix`
1. Run `home-manager switch`

Enjoy!
