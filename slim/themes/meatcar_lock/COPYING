Some FAQs:

1. If you are the only user in your system, it is recommended to enable the "direct log-in" function in SLiM.

	file: /etc/slim.conf
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	...
	# default user, leave blank or remove this line
	# for avoid pre-loading the username.
	default_user YOURUSERNAMEHERE

	# Focus the password field on start when default_user is set
	# Set to "yes" to enable this feature
	focus_password yes
	...
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. For the avatar, edit the panel.png with your image editor and simply place your avatar and save.
